# The Unity VR Ender3 3D Printer

## This Project

This is a project created last year for the Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Dept at the University of Oklahoma. I have put it on github with the goal of updating, refining, and expanding the project.

Here is a link to the video of the project running. [Link](https://youtu.be/wmO6mNcXpJM)

## Future Plans
- Polish the VR space
- Implement an interpolative filament generation algorithm
- Optimize the existing process to speed up the simulation for education purposes (i.e. 1000x print speed)
